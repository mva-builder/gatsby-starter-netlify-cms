  title: Changing the narrative of the American military veteran
  description: >-
    The primary under-represented groups that MVA serves are: veterans of color,
    womxn, LGBTQ, and religious and non-religious minorities. We believe that in
    bringing these four minority groups together we can build a community that
    encompasses veterans from a wide range of diverse backgrounds and
    experiences.
description: >-
  MVA was founded by two University of Washington Husky veterans, Lindsay Church
  and Katherine Pratt. Church and Pratt first began their work in 2014 through
  the Husky United Military Veterans where they built a Diversity Committee that
  celebrated the underrepresented groups within the student veteran community at
  the University of Washington.  Since 2014, Church and Pratt have collaborated
  to lead the student veteran population at the UW, Church through her role in
  the Student Veteran Life office, and Pratt as the President of the student
  veteran organization, Husky Veterans. Today, they partner to build and grow
  MVA in order to celebrate the identities that they both feel that they hold
  that make them underrepresented in the veteran community.

  description: >-
    Founded in November 2017, the Minority Veterans of America (MVA) is a
    501(c)3 non-profit organization that was designed to change the narrative of
    the American military veteran. The team of MVA works to build community
    around the unique identities that veterans hold, outside of their identity
    as a military servicemember.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
